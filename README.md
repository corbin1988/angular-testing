## Introduction

Software testing is the process of assessing the functionality of a software program. The process checks for errors and gaps and whether the outcome of the application matches desired expectations before the software is installed and goes live. The main things software testing hopes to accomplish are:

### Bug Detection and Prevention:
Testing helps identify and eliminate bugs and errors in the early stages of development. This prevents issues from escalating into critical problems during production, saving time and resources.
### Enhances Software Quality:
Thorough testing ensures that software meets the specified requirements and adheres to quality standards. This, in turn, leads to the delivery of a high-quality product that satisfies user expectations.
### Improved Code Quality:
Writing testable code encourages developers to follow best practices, resulting in cleaner, modular, and maintainable code. This contributes to better overall code quality and reduces technical debt.
### Increased Confidence in Code Changes:
Continuous testing provides developers with confidence when making changes or adding new features. Knowing that existing functionality is safeguarded by tests allows for more agile development and iteration.
### Supports Continuous Integration and Deployment:
Testing is a cornerstone of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Automated tests ensure that code changes do not introduce regressions, enabling a smoother and faster release process.
### Documentation and Understanding:
Tests serve as a form of documentation, providing insights into the expected behavior of the code. This aids not only in understanding existing code but also in onboarding new team members.

## Testing Philosophy

One of the reasons software testing is so difficult is because the multitude of approaches. Different companies, programming languages, frameworks, and individuals hold varying opinions on how software should be tested. In this section we’ll speak about three things: code coverage, opinionation, why companies have different levels of testing, and testing methodology/workflow. 

### Code Coverage

Code coverage in essence is how much of the code base is tested. 

### Software Opinionation

Software opinionation refers to a design or architectural approach that includes strong, often predefined, opinions about how the software should be structured, organized, and implemented. Opinionated software typically enforces a specific set of conventions, best practices, or design patterns, guiding developers in making certain decisions.

Conversely, unopinionated or flexible software allows developers more freedom and choices in how they structure and implement their code. It provides a framework or toolset without imposing strict rules or preferences.

#### Opinionated Software

##### Pros:
Clear guidelines and conventions lead to consistent code.
Faster development due to reduced decision-making.
Can be beneficial for teams where consistency is crucial.
##### Cons:
Less flexibility for developers who prefer alternative approaches.
May not fit well with specific project requirements or constraints.

#### Unopinionated Software:

##### Pros:
Offers flexibility, allowing developers to choose their preferred structures.
Adaptable to diverse project requirements.
Appeals to developers who value creative freedom.
##### Cons:
May lead to inconsistencies in code style and structure.
Increased decision-making can slow down development for some teams.
An example of opinionation in software development is the choice of a web framework. Some frameworks, like Ruby on Rails, are opinionated and come with a set of conventions and best practices that developers are encouraged to follow. On the other hand, frameworks like Express.js for Node.js are unopinionated, providing more flexibility and leaving many decisions to the developers.

Ultimately, whether a software project is opinionated or unopinionated depends on the specific goals, preferences, and requirements of the developers and the project itself.

### How much to test?

You will get software testing evangalists on one side saying "always!" and on the other side saying "never!" When it comes to testing coverage you'll also get evaganlists that preach "you should aim as close to 100% code coverage as you can!" So what's the truth? The answer, as always in software development, is it depends. 

It's fair to say that the more test coverage the more opinionated a codebase becomes. As stated above, there's reasons you might want more opinionation and more flexability. The same thing can be said about adding in tests. For ease we'll discuss three code coverage scenarios: No testing/No code coverage, some code coverage, high code coverage:

#### No Coverage/No Tests

Since writing tests comes with opinions and time overhead, many companies, especially smaller ones like startups, choose not to write frontend tests. The primary reason is a need for flexibility and code velocity. For startups, the goal is to roll out features as quickly as possible to users. Writing tests can not only consume time but may also impede product development in a highly competitive market. Additionally, writing tests requires more developer time, translating to increased costs for the company. This trade-off between speed and testing is a common consideration in resource-constrained environments.

Another philosphy that preaches not implenting tests is "build nets, not guard rails." The idea is that code should follow a certain standard where it's acceptable to fail. Instead of using opinionation that can make a codebase rigid and hard to iterate with, you should use specific standards that tries to prevent bugs that unit tests could catch. For example, Typescript making sure a functions inputs and outputs are valid. 

The last argument against testing on the frontend is the nature of the javascript ech system itself. While most frameworks and libraries seem to be going towards longterm stability and support, it wasn't always like that. The life cycle of a javascript app for many smaller companies might be that they're writing the app to be rewritten later on. In this case, the overhead of writing tests might not be worth it.

#### High code coverage

In the [introduction](#introduction) we provided examples as to why you should test. A good rule of thumb for why companies, teams, or individuals would choose to implement high test coverage are when the stakes for product failure are high to the user. For example the following applications:

- Anything based around safety that could mean life or death:
  - Medical devices
  - Safety Equipment
- Financial transactions
- Anything that poses a major security risk (personal data, secrets, sensitive data in general)
- Devices or software that is only purchased once, isn't frequently updated, and needs to run reliably:
  - Hardware devices that don't connect to the internet
  - Games that aren't connected to the internet

Anything where the margin for error needs to be low and the consequences of a bug in the code could cause something catastrophic to happen should have high test coverage.

#### Some Code Coverage

Maintaining a test coverage range of 40% to 70% offers a balanced approach that combines flexibility with the assurance of testing. Striking this middle ground accommodates scenarios where the need for adaptability in building new features coexists with the necessity of rigorous testing, particularly in critical areas like security and databases.

In software development, the requirement for untested flexibility arises when innovating and introducing new features. This level of code coverage acknowledges that not every aspect of the codebase demands immediate testing. Instead, it reserves the freedom to explore creative solutions and iterate rapidly, essential in environments where agility is paramount.

Simultaneously, the prescribed coverage range ensures a baseline of testing, especially in realms crucial to the system's integrity. Security considerations and interactions with databases, where data accuracy and reliability are paramount, benefit from a more comprehensive testing approach. Striking a balance in code coverage acknowledges the dual needs of development—innovation and reliability—creating a pragmatic framework for effective software testing.

### Testing Methodology/Workflow

Testing workflows and methodologies dictate when tests are written during the development process. For simplicity, we'll categorize this into three sections: testing before code implementation (TDD), testing while writing code (BDD), and testing after code has been written (PDT).

#### Writing Tests Before Code Implementation With TDD

Test-Driven Development (TDD) falls into this category, where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The idea is to define the expected behavior first and then write code to fulfill those expectations.

#### Writing Tests While Implementing Code With BDD

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a testing methodology where tests are written concurrently with code development. In BDD, the focus is on describing the expected behavior of the software using natural language specifications, often expressed in "Given-When-Then" syntax. This approach encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of the software's functionality. BDD aligns testing with the ongoing development process, allowing for continuous validation of expected behaviors as the code evolves.

#### Writing Tests After Code Has Been Written With Post-Development Testing or Post-Implementation Testing

Post-Development Testing or Post-Implementation Testing is when tests are created after the code has been implemented. This is more common in traditional development processes or when testing is a separate phase following code implementation.

**Disclaimer** 

The amount of software testing that can be introduced into codebase can also be based on person prefrence of a developer or team with no rhyme or reason to their decisions other than they like testing or hate it. 

## Types of Tests

Testing in Angular applications involves various types of tests that serve different purposes in ensuring the reliability and functionality of the software. These tests can be broadly categorized into three main types: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and End-to-End (E2E) Testing.

### Unit Testing:

#### Purpose

Focuses on testing individual units or components of the application in isolation.

#### Scope 

Tests the smallest parts of the code, such as functions or methods, to ensure they work as expected.

#### Advantages 

Helps identify and fix bugs at an early stage, promotes modular and maintainable code.

### Integration Testing:

#### Purpose: 

Verifies that different units or components work together as expected when integrated.

#### Scope: 

Tests interactions between multiple units to ensure the seamless collaboration of integrated parts.

#### Advantages: 

Detects issues arising from the combination of units, ensuring the overall system functions correctly.

#### End-to-End (E2E) Testing:

#### Purpose: 

Evaluates the entire application workflow, simulating real user scenarios.

#### Scope: 

Tests the application as a whole, including its user interface, to ensure all components work together in a real-world setting.

#### Advantages: 

Provides a comprehensive view of the application's behavior, helping catch issues related to the entire user journey.

## Angular Testing

### Introduction

Angular testing relies on powerful tools like Jasmine and Karma to ensure the reliability and functionality of applications. Jasmine, a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework, provides an expressive syntax for writing tests in a readable manner. With its describe-it syntax and various features such as expectations and spies, Jasmine facilitates the creation of clear and comprehensive unit tests. On the other hand, Karma serves as a versatile test runner, allowing the execution of tests in multiple real browsers and providing a robust testing environment. Together, Jasmine and Karma form a dynamic duo in the Angular testing toolkit, supporting the creation, execution, and reporting of tests to ensure the delivery of high-quality and bug-free applications. 

### Jasmine:
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development (BDD) testing framework for JavaScript. It provides a syntax that reads like plain English and is designed to make the testing process more readable and expressive. Jasmine is often used for writing unit tests in Angular applications. Key features of Jasmine include:

#### Describe-It Syntax: 

Jasmine uses a descriptive syntax that makes it easy to understand test cases. Tests are organized using describe blocks, and individual test cases are written within it blocks.

#### Expectations: 

Jasmine introduces the concept of expectations with the expect function. Expectations define the conditions that should be true for a test to pass. Matchers like toEqual, toBeGreaterThan, etc., are used for comparisons.

#### Spies: 

Spies in Jasmine allow you to mock functions and track their behavior. This is useful for testing how functions are called, what they return, or if they are called at all.

Before and After Hooks: Jasmine provides beforeEach and afterEach hooks that allow you to set up and tear down common conditions for your tests, promoting clean and modular test code.

### Karma:

Karma is a test runner for JavaScript that is widely used in Angular projects. It provides a test environment where you can execute your Jasmine (or other testing framework) tests in various real browsers. Key features of Karma include:

#### Cross-Browser Testing: 

Karma allows you to run your tests in multiple browsers simultaneously, helping ensure cross-browser compatibility.

#### Continuous Integration: 

It is designed to integrate seamlessly with continuous integration (CI) systems. Karma can be set up to run tests automatically whenever code changes are detected, providing rapid feedback during development.

#### Test Result Reporting: 

Karma provides a dashboard that displays the results of your tests in real-time. It shows which tests passed, failed, or are currently running.

#### Plugin System: 

Karma has a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality. You can add plugins for code coverage reporting, additional testing frameworks, or other features.

### First Test

In this test we will be using a simple logger and calculator service that adds and subtracts numbers. In the `add` and `subtract` method the logger logs the function that is being called.

**logger.service.ts**

```TS
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class LoggerService {
  // Method to log messages to the console
  log(message: string): void {
    console.log(message);
  }
}
```

**calculator.service.ts**

```TS
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { LoggerService } from './logger.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class CalculatorService {
  // Inject the LoggerService in the constructor
  constructor(private logger: LoggerService) {}

  // Method to add two numbers
  add(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    this.logger.log('add method has been called');
    return num1 + num2;
  }

  // Method to subtract the second number from the first
  subtract(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    this.logger.log('subtract method has been called');
    return num1 - num2;
  }
}
```

**calculator.service.spec.ts**

```TS
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator.service';
import { LoggerService } from './logger.service';

describe('CalculatorService', () => {
  it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(8);
  });

  it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
    const result = calculatorService.subtract(10, 4);
    expect(result).toBe(6);
  });
});
```

### The Anatomy of Our First Test

In Jasmine, describe and it are functions used for structuring and organizing test suites.

#### describe:

**Purpose:** It is used to group related test specs (individual test cases) together, creating a test suite.

**Syntax:** `describe(description: string, specDefinitions: () => void): void`

**Example:***

```TS
describe('CalculatorService', () => {
  // Test specs go here
});
```

Note: Nesting describe blocks is common to further organize tests.

#### it:

**Purpose:** It represents an individual test case or specification within a test suite. Each it block should focus on a specific behavior or scenario.

**Syntax:** `it(expectation: string, assertion: () => void): void`

**Example:**

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
  // Test assertions go here
});
```

Note: It's good practice to have a single expectation per it block to keep tests focused and easy to understand.

### The Phases of Our First Test

In a test, the setup phase gets everything ready, the execution phase puts the specific behavior to the test, and the assertion phase checks if the results match what's expected. It's like preparing, performing, and checking in a neat sequence to ensure the code does what it's supposed to do.

**Test We'll Be Using**

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(8);
});
```

#### Setup Phase

The Setup Phase is where we prepare the necessary components and dependencies for the test. In this case, we are creating an instance of CalculatorService and providing it with a LoggerService. This ensures that the service has the required dependencies to perform the test.

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
});
```

#### The Execution Phase

The Execution Phase involves the actual execution of the functionality being tested. Here, we call the add method on the calculatorService instance with the numbers 5 and 3. This phase is where we trigger the specific behavior we want to test.

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
    //Execution
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
});
```

#### The Assertion Phase

The Assertion Phase is where we verify that the executed functionality behaves as expected. We use the expect statement to make assertions about the value returned from the add method. In this case, we expect the result to be 8.

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
    //Assertion
    expect(result).toBe(8);
});
```
### Using Spys For Enhanced Isolation

Isolation in unit tests is crucial to validate the specific behavior of a single unit (in this case, the CalculatorService) without being affected by the functionality or behavior of its dependencies (like the LoggerService). Spies facilitate this isolation by creating mock instances of dependencies.

Going back to our old code:

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(8);
});
```
In this case, the test is creating a real instance of CalculatorService along with a real LoggerService. This test is more integrated and less isolated as it relies on the actual implementation of LoggerService. It ensures that the add method returns the expected result but doesn't verify any interaction or behavior of the LoggerService itself.

#### What is a spy?

A spy in testing is a function or an object that allows us to observe, track, and control how certain functions, methods, or objects are being used within our tests. It helps in verifying that specific functions or methods are called, how many times they are called, with which arguments, and even allows us to mock their behavior. In essence, spies provide a way to monitor and manage the interactions between different parts of our code during testing, aiding in verifying the expected behavior and usage of components without affecting their actual functionality.

#### Importance of using a spy

Using a spy creates a mock LoggerService instance, allowing for better isolation of the CalculatorService under test. This test not only verifies the functionality of the add method but also checks the interaction between CalculatorService and LoggerService. It ensures that the add method triggers the log method on the LoggerService with a specific message, providing a more comprehensive test by verifying both behavior and interaction.

```TS
it('should add two numbers', () => {
    const loggerService = jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']);
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(loggerService);
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
    // Assertion
    expect(result).toBe(8);
    expect(loggerService.log).toHaveBeenCalledWith('add method has been called');
});
```

In the example above we remove:

```TS
const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(new LoggerService());
```

And create a SPY to further issolate our code:

```TS
const loggerService = jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']);
```

#### Why use a SPY?

**Isolation of Testing:** Spies allow us to create mock instances of dependencies, such as the LoggerService, ensuring that the test focuses only on the behavior of the CalculatorService and not its dependencies. This isolates the testing scenario, making it more specific and less prone to interference from external factors.

**Controlled Behavior:** By creating a spy, we can monitor and track method calls, ensuring that the methods are invoked as expected. In this case, we can verify if the log method of the LoggerService is called with the appropriate message, adding an extra assertion to validate the interaction between services.

**Avoiding Real Service Calls:** Using a spy prevents actual calls to the real LoggerService methods. This is beneficial in testing to avoid unwanted side effects, such as logging to the console or triggering actions in real services, which might not be desirable or necessary in unit tests.

### Using `beforeEach` For Setup

In our last example we were repeating the setup phase to create a logger spy in each test (See code comment):

```TS
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator.service';
import { LoggerService } from './logger.service';

describe('CalculatorService', () => {
  it('should add two numbers', () => {
    //Setup phase
    const loggerService = jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']);
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(loggerService);
    const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(8);
  });

  it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
    //Setup phase
    const loggerService = jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']);
    const calculatorService = new CalculatorService(loggerService);
    const result = calculatorService.subtract(10, 4);
    expect(result).toBe(6);
  });
});
```

Instead of reproducing the logger service spy we can instantiate it once in the `beforeEach` method. The beforeEach method does exactly as described. It executes test setup beforeEach test. 

```TS
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator.service';
import { LoggerService } from './logger.service';

describe('CalculatorService', () => {
    let calculatorService: CalculatorService;
    let loggerService: jasmine.SpyObj<LoggerService>;

    beforeEach(() => {
        loggerService = jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']);
        calculatorService = new CalculatorService(loggerService);
    });

    it('should add two numbers', () => {
        const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
        expect(result).toBe(8);
    });

    it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
        const result = calculatorService.subtract(10, 4);
        expect(result).toBe(6);
    });
});
```

### A Note About Dependency Injection And Testing

In calculator `calculator.service.ts` we are injecting the LoggerService into the Calculator via the constructor. We will rarely see code like this:

```TS
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class CalculatorService {
  private logger: LoggerService = new LoggerService(); // Instantiate LoggerService

  // Method to add two numbers
  add(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    this.logger.log('add method has been called');
    return num1 + num2;
  }

  // Method to subtract the second number from the first
  subtract(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    this.logger.log('subtract method has been called');
    return num1 - num2;
  }
}
```

One of the reasons we inject into the construct like the beneath code is for testability:

```TS
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { LoggerService } from './logger.service';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root',
})
export class CalculatorService {
  // Inject the LoggerService in the constructor
  constructor(private logger: LoggerService) {}

  // Method to add two numbers
  add(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    this.logger.log('add method has been called');
    return num1 + num2;
  }

  // Method to subtract the second number from the first
  subtract(num1: number, num2: number): number {
    this.logger.log('subtract method has been called');
    return num1 - num2;
  }
}
```
This allows us to easily inject our LoggerService into the CalculatorService for testing:

```TS
beforeEach(() => {
  loggerService = jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']);
  calculatorService = new CalculatorService(loggerService);
});
```

### Angular TestBed

The Angular TestBed is a powerful utility that allows you to configure and create an Angular testing module for your unit tests. It provides an environment for testing Angular components, services, and other parts of your application. Here's how you can modify the test to use the TestBed:

```TS
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { CalculatorService } from './calculator.service';
import { LoggerService } from './logger.service';

describe('CalculatorService', () => {
    let calculatorService: CalculatorService;
    let loggerService: jasmine.SpyObj<LoggerService>;

    beforeEach(() => {
        TestBed.configureTestingModule({
            providers: [
                CalculatorService,
                {
                    provide: LoggerService,
                    useValue: jasmine.createSpyObj('LoggerService', ['log']),
                },
            ],
        });
        
        calculatorService = TestBed.inject(CalculatorService);
        loggerService = TestBed.inject(LoggerService) as jasmine.SpyObj<LoggerService>;
    });

    it('should add two numbers', () => {
        const result = calculatorService.add(5, 3);
        expect(result).toBe(8);
    });

    it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
        const result = calculatorService.subtract(10, 4);
        expect(result).toBe(6);
    });
});
```

#### Explanation:

- `TestBed.configureTestingModule` is used to set up an Angular testing module, mimicking an Angular module configuration.
- Inside `configureTestingModule`, providers are specified using the `providers` array. Here, `CalculatorService` is provided as well as a mocked `LoggerService` created using `jasmine.createSpyObj`.
- `TestBed.inject` is used to retrieve instances of services within the testing module. `calculatorService` and `loggerService` are obtained using `TestBed.inject`.
- The tests then use these injected instances to test the functionality of `CalculatorService`.

The `TestBed`, by setting up the testing environment, allows for the simulation of an Angular module, providing the necessary dependencies for testing components, services, and other Angular entities in an isolated manner. This setup facilitates effective unit testing by creating controlled environments for testing Angular elements.
