# Angular Testing

## Introduction

Software testing is the process of assessing the functionality of a software program. The process checks for errors and gaps and whether the outcome of the application matches desired expectations before the software is installed and goes live. The main things software testing hopes to accomplish are:

### Bug Detection and Prevention:
Testing helps identify and eliminate bugs and errors in the early stages of development. This prevents issues from escalating into critical problems during production, saving time and resources.
### Enhances Software Quality:
Thorough testing ensures that software meets the specified requirements and adheres to quality standards. This, in turn, leads to the delivery of a high-quality product that satisfies user expectations.
### Improved Code Quality:
Writing testable code encourages developers to follow best practices, resulting in cleaner, modular, and maintainable code. This contributes to better overall code quality and reduces technical debt.
### Increased Confidence in Code Changes:
Continuous testing provides developers with confidence when making changes or adding new features. Knowing that existing functionality is safeguarded by tests allows for more agile development and iteration.
### Cost-Effectiveness:
Identifying and fixing defects early in the development process is more cost-effective than addressing issues in production. The cost of fixing a bug increases significantly as the software progresses through development stages.
### Supports Continuous Integration and Deployment:
Testing is a cornerstone of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Automated tests ensure that code changes do not introduce regressions, enabling a smoother and faster release process.
### Documentation and Understanding:
Tests serve as a form of documentation, providing insights into the expected behavior of the code. This aids not only in understanding existing code but also in onboarding new team members.
